## The problem

I started going through all material, lectures and videos we got. I started coding with that info. I needed to google (a lot) and inspect a bunch of webpages in order to go deeper in understanding how things works. I started from zero several times to increase my understanding on html structure and styling. I used VSC code as a main and codepen as a support. 

Try-fail-understand loop until success. 

When I started my first lines of code I didn't have a plan. I realized that I needed to create some kind of structure in both the html and css files to find me around.
